# MastersProject_Analyzing-and-Enhancing-Mental-Health-Using-Twitter-Data


## Introduction

This repository contains the Streamlit application and code for the M-Check Performance Analysis. The project aims to visualize and explore mental health metrics.

**Note**: Due to the large volume of the dataset, it isn't included in the repository.

## Content

1. **Code from Colab**: Analysis scripts and notebooks.
2. **M-Check Code from VSCode**: The main source code of the M-Check system implemented using Streamlit.

## Usage

1. **For Colab notebooks**:
 - Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab.
 - contains data collection code
 - deep learning models code for analysis
 

2. **For M-Check Streamlit App**: 
 - Navigate to the respective directory.
 - Start the Streamlit app:
 ```
 streamlit run [script_name].py
 ```

## Data

The dataset used for this project is not provided due to its large volume and privacy consideration. [However, we dropped a code in the colab for data collection]
